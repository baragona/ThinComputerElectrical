Goal: run E Ink off USBC with no large parts or other boards.

Battery-only version BOM:
	flex board
	rigid USBc board

	ADDED/done:
	Charger https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/MCP73831-Family-Data-Sheet-DS20001984H.pdf
	associated caps and resistors for charging
	3.3 regulator https://www.renesas.com/us/en/document/dst/isl9122a-datasheet
	associated caps and inductor for regulator	
	voltage lockout chip: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/MIC826RYMT-TR/4004811
	Charging LED
	8mm between battery pads
	9mm between different battery's pads
	Add all battery Pads and position them properly
	Ensure there is clearance around batteries
	Add load testing LED: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/samsung-semiconductor-inc/SCP7RTJ5HEL1RLQF6E/8535775
	Add load testing resistor pads: P1E101CT-ND
	Replaceable zero ohm resistor for testing current
	Charge at 37 mA = 27k Prog resistor charge
	A way to disconnect the battery without soldering: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sullins-connector-solutions/GEC02SBSN-M89/862281
	Pads to connect external output
	Pick R,L,C components and fix footprints
	Add design rules from PCB fab.
	Ensure caps/inductors are close as possible to chips
	Ensure board dimensions are correct
	Add vias around chips through planes
	fix silkscreens

	TODO:
	Order solder paste
	Tweezers
	hot air?


	
	

Use a FPC breakout board.

ESP32 wants 500ma though. Maybe this is a no-battery version

Flex Board 1 BOM
Flex connector for e ink
Connect to USBC board

Board 2:
USBC connector
Connect to flex board


how long would 75mAh battery take to discharge at 1uA
1mAh would be 75 hours
1uA would be 75000 hours
10uA would be 7500 hours = 312 days
ie 10uA would be a good under voltage lockout / quiescent current
