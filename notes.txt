Goal: run E Ink off USBC with no large parts or other boards.


Issues so far:
Trimpot footprint is wrong ∆
Alignment with usbc board is wrong ∆
Jumper position is awkward ∆
Island in the PCB layout ∆
Add real thermal vias ∆
Put rev2 note on new board ∆

Tests remaining
How to get 5v from apple chargers

Next boards:
	Add CPU
	Add e ink connector
	Add buttons
	Add debug port
	GPIO LEDs
	Serial Port, gpio outs

Initial Specifications:
	At least 5 buttons
	Credit card size +- 1cm
	No more than 1mm thick
	USBC port for charging the battery
	STM32 CPU
	Internal battery
	E Ink display which refreshes in about .3s for partial screen updates.
	No power required when not updating the screen - very long battery life when not actively in use.
	Ability to display multiple pages of stored text or images.
	Ability to load code onto the processor - fully open source software
	Ability to run C or Rust programs with some examples
	Initial parts are not waterproof. Do not get them wet.
	The cards may have steel backing, or PCB material depending on development costs.
	The durability and longevity of the initial units is totally unknown as this is the first shipment of parts.
	Cost: $100 per card for 100 cards, paid $5000 up front, paid $5000 upon delivery of the last units.
	Delivery Timeline: as soon as possible. Best estimate is likely 3-6 months.

	

Battery-only version BOM:
	flex board
	rigid USBc board

	ADDED/done:
	Charger https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/MCP73831-Family-Data-Sheet-DS20001984H.pdf

	voltage lockout chip: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/MIC826RYMT-TR/4004811
	Charging LED
	8mm between battery pads
	9mm between different battery's pads
	Add all battery Pads and position them properly
	Ensure there is clearance around batteries
	Add load testing LED: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/samsung-semiconductor-inc/SCP7RTJ5HEL1RLQF6E/8535775

	A way to disconnect the battery without soldering: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sullins-connector-solutions/GEC02SBSN-M89/862281
	Pads to connect external output
	Pick R,L,C components and fix footprints
	Add design rules from PCB fab.
	Ensure caps/inductors are close as possible to chips
	Ensure board dimensions are correct
	Add vias around chips through planes
	fix silkscreens


The CPU should be able to measure the 3.3V, the battery voltage, the charger input voltage


	

Use a FPC breakout board.

how long would 75mAh battery take to discharge at 1uA
1mAh would be 75 hours
1uA would be 75000 hours
10uA would be 7500 hours = 312 days
ie 10uA would be a good under voltage lockout / quiescent current
